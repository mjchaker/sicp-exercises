## SICP Exercises

This repository contains the source code of some Scheme programs, and you can run them using a Scheme interpreter. The modern ones are MIT/GNU Scheme (runs in your terminal)
and DrRacket (runs in a graphical window). Note that MIT/GNU Scheme does not natively run on Apple Silicon chips.

If using DrRacket, remove the "#lang sicp" line (if present) and use the load procedure in interactive mode; if you are using DrRacket, keep the aforementioned line.
This line tell the interpreter to use Scheme rather than Racket (Racket is a more modern dialect of Lisp)
For information on how to use either of the interpreters, use your search engine of choice to find and read the user manuals
