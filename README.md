# SICP Exercise Solutions

This repository contains solutions to exercises from "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP) by Abelson and Sussman. All solutions are implemented in Scheme and are compatible with MIT/GNU Scheme.

**Note:** Some solutions or parts of solutions may incorporate ideas, approaches, or code from various sources including textbooks, online resources, and community discussions. This is a learning repository that combines original work with educational material from multiple sources.

## Repository Structure

### Exercise Solutions
- **`.scm` files**: Complete Scheme implementations with detailed step-by-step evaluation traces
- **`.txt` files**: Text-based answers for theoretical exercises that don't require code
- **Special implementations**: Reusable algorithms like Pascal's triangle (`pascal.scm`)

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Recursive vs Iterative Processes
Many exercises (especially 1-11, 1-16 through 1-18) explore the difference between:
- **Recursive processes**: Operations deferred until base case, memory grows with recursion depth
- **Iterative processes**: State maintained in variables, constant memory usage

### Mathematical Algorithms
- Prime number testing and optimization
- Numerical methods (Newton's method for roots)
- Fast arithmetic operations (exponentiation, multiplication)
- Greatest common divisor algorithms

### Performance Analysis
- Time complexity analysis with actual timing measurements
- Order of growth studies
- Comparison of different algorithmic approaches

### Evaluation Strategies
- Applicative-order vs normal-order evaluation
- Impact of evaluation order on program behavior
- Conditional expression evaluation

## Running the Code

### Prerequisites
- Install [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) with SICP language support
- Or use DrRacket IDE

### Execution
```bash
# Run individual files
racket filename.scm

# Or open in DrRacket IDE for interactive development
```

All `.scm` files include `#lang sicp` at the top and are ready to run directly.

## Code Features

- **Detailed Comments**: Step-by-step evaluation traces showing how expressions are computed
- **Multiple Implementations**: Often includes both recursive and iterative versions
- **Helper Functions**: Clear naming conventions (e.g., `function-name-iter` for iterative versions)
- **Performance Testing**: Timing functions for algorithm comparison
- **Mathematical Focus**: Heavy emphasis on numerical algorithms and computational mathematics

## Documentation

- `CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions and development guidelines
- `recursive-vs-iterative-processes.md` - Detailed explanation of process types

## Progress

Currently working through Chapter 1 exercises, with focus on:
- ✅ Basic recursive and iterative patterns
- ✅ Mathematical algorithm implementations  
- ✅ Performance analysis and optimization
- ⏳ Advanced higher-order procedures (in progress)

## Attribution

This repository combines original work with educational material from various sources. Some solutions or solution approaches may be derived from:
- The SICP textbook and its official solutions
- Online educational resources and tutorials
- Community discussions and forums
- Academic materials and references

The goal is educational understanding of computational concepts rather than claiming originality of all implementations.
